Subject: [PATCH] [Stability][hwui]Fix Native Crash of EGL_BAD_ALLOC

The Toast window executes eglCreateWindowSurface in RenderThread to
prepare connect to BufferQueue. If the surface has been destroyed,
it will report EGL_BAD_ALLOC error and cause the native crash. If it
is the system_server, the system_server will directly cause the dead
machine to restart. After the survey found in the N version have
modified code logic of Toast, increased when Toast to remove
removeWindowToken operation, the operation is in
NotificationManagerService thread execution,relative to Toast window
UI thread belongs to the asynchronous operation, the asynchronous
operation in the case of a problem will directly destroy surface, leading
to the problem. Through the process removeWindowToken parameters,
make NotificationManagerService thread does not destroy the surface
operation, unified by the Toast of the UI thread to process the surface
of the create and destroy to solve this problem.
