Subject: [PATCH] ConnectivityService doesn't send decreased score to factories at need

When there is more than one network, after Score of a network fell down
requests of that network are removed from its "networkRequests" during
process of rematchNetworkAndRequests().

As a result, current implementation of updateNetworkScore()
cannot send score of that network in sendUpdatedScoreToFactories().
This may prevent other network factories from updating their status,
e.g. TelephonyNetworkFactory cannot enable APN.

Therefore, we add process of sending decreased score into
rematchNetworkAndRequests() to fix the issue.
