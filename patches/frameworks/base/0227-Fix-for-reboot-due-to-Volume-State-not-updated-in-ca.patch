Subject: [PATCH 227/296] Fix for reboot due to Volume State not updated in
 callback

When repeatedly formatting external sdcard as portable & internal
storage there is a possibility of state mismatch in App listener
volume state and actual volume state maintained by vold. This
results in reboot when try to create User directory in package-
manager when the volume is unmounted

The change verifies current volume state as well when volume state
change callback is received in package-manager. This avoids the
problem of volume state mismatch
