Subject: [PATCH] Fix ResolverActivity don't show items

ResolverActivity sort the list resolved intent with AsyncTask.
The method sort hold CountDownLatch to wait the time-consuming
operation. In some case, the operation doesn't end and the
CountDownLatch can't be released.The default excutor of AsyncTask
is serial. There should release CountDownLatch in destroy()
to avoid this case.
