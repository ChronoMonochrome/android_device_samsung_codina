Subject: [PATCH] Systemserver crash issue.

The LegacyGlobalAction's dialog may be create in two thread, since 
view's UI operation can only do in one thread, it may occur systemserver
crash during monkey.

This issue may reproduce when SystemUI is crash or killing when ANR.

Fix: create the dialog useing the handler thread only.
